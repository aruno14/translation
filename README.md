# Translation model using Seq2Seq model
This project contains some scripts to create translation Seq2Seq model.

## Dataset
Scripts use data from [Tatoeba.org](https://tatoeba.org/). You have to download them your self to use scripts.

## Scripts
### trad_attention.py
Seq2Seq with attention model. The code is based on: [Pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html).
